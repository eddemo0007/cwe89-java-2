The use of a hard-coded password significantly increases the possibility that the account being protected will be compromised.  Moreover, the password cannot be changed without patching the software.  If a hard-coded password is compromised in a commercial product, all deployed instances may be vulnerable to attack.  In some cases, this finding may indicate a reference to a password (e.g. the name of a key in a properties file) rather than an actual password. java.sql.DriverManager.getConnection\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003eStore passwords out-of-band from the application code.
